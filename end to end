Understanding the Problem: Imagine you have a large collection of sentences, reviews, or messages, and you want to automatically sort them into groups like "positive" or "negative," or more complex categories like "sports," "politics," and "entertainment." This project uses a powerful AI model, BERT, to achieve this efficiently and accurately.

Gathering and Preparing Data: The first step is collecting a dataset. For example, if you're analyzing product reviews, youâ€™ll have sentences with labels like "positive" or "negative." This dataset is then cleaned to remove unwanted characters or words, ensuring the AI learns only meaningful patterns.

Tokenization (Breaking Down Sentences): Computers can't directly understand text; they understand numbers. BERT breaks down sentences into smaller parts called tokens and converts them into numeric formats. It also keeps track of word positions to understand context.

Building and Training the Model: Using BERT, we create a text classification model. The model is trained on the prepared data, learning patterns and relationships. For example, it might learn that words like "great" and "excellent" often indicate positive sentiment, while "bad" and "terrible" indicate negative sentiment.

Evaluating the Model: After training, the model is tested on new, unseen data to see how well it can classify text. This step ensures the model doesn't just memorize the training data but generalizes its understanding to other text inputs.

Making Predictions: Once the model is ready, you can give it any text, and it will classify it into the appropriate category. For example, if you input "This product is amazing," the model might classify it as "positive."

Deploying the Model: The final step is deploying the model, making it accessible through a website or app. Businesses or users can then input text and get instant results, making decisions based on the classification.
